* [Virtualization Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR0rG3HKIk) ---
Nice and concise explanation about virtualization in virtual machines. I wish I watched this video first before taking the first week's quiz because this video explains a lot of things that is on the quiz.

* [you need to learn Virtual Machines RIGHT NOW!! (Kali Linux VM, Ubuntu, Windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM)
Not too different from the step-by-step tutorial on how to install VirtualBox from VLSM website, but this video explains the steps in more details.

* [Vim Crash Course For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXud3JybsG4) --- 
Very good supplementary tutorial on how to use VIM. Because of it, I can finally exit VIM without turning off my VM :D

* [Zenbleed (CVE-2023-20593)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EY_9KtxyPg)
Interesting topic about exploitation on AMD CPU's weakness. Using a very short assembly code to be able to leak server memory from other customer (I don't really understand what this means, but it sounds terrifying).

* [The Discovery of Zenbleed ft. Tavis Ormandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neWc0H1k2Lc)
How Zenbleed was discovered, explaining from who the founder is, the fundamental behind the exploitation, and finally putting all the pieces together.
